## BUDGET NARRATIVE SUMMARY

**Personnel (34%):** Largest category funds essential staff managing all project components. Mix of EFMEP funds and cost share ensures sustainable staffing model.

**Construction/Renovation (23%):** Second-largest category reflects major physical rebuilding needs. Dwarven in-kind contributions (stone, engineering) significantly reduce costs while ensuring quality.

**Supplies (8%):** Supports diverse activities from tree planting to counseling to community events.

**Indirect (6%):** Modest overhead covers organizational sustainability and full administrative costs.

**Partnerships:** Extraordinary in-kind contributions ($68,000 from Gondor/Lothlórien professionals + $80,000 volunteer labor) stretch every grant dollar significantly.

**Cost Efficiency:** Total project cost of $120,000 serves 1,050 Hobbits = $114/person for comprehensive community transformation - exceptional value.

## BUDGET JUSTIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS

**Why This Budget is Appropriate:**

1. **Staff-Intensive by Necessity:** Complex, multi-component project requires coordinated professional management across construction, agriculture, mental health, culture, and economics.

2. **Construction Efficiency:** Using trained Hobbit labor ($12/hr) rather than expensive external contractors, with Dwarven supervision ensuring quality.

3. **Leverage:** Every EFMEP dollar leverages $0.33 in cost share + $0.82 in additional in-kind = $2.15 total value per grant dollar.

4. **Proven Rates:** Salary rates reflect modest Shire wage standards (verified with local businesses); far below rates in Gondor or Bree-land.

5. **Community Investment:** Massive volunteer labor ($80,000 value) demonstrates community ownership and sustainability likelihood.

6. **No Waste:** Budget contains no luxury items, travel beyond necessity, or excessive administrative costs. Every line item directly supports project objectives.
