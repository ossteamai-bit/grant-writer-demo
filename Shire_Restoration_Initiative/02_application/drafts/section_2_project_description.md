## Project Overview

The Shire Restoration Initiative is a comprehensive 18-month community recovery program designed to address the catastrophic physical, economic, psychological, and cultural damage inflicted during Sharkey's occupation. The project integrates six interconnected components that emerged directly from community needs assessment and participatory planning processes led by Mayor Samwise Gamgee and the Shire Restoration Society.

This project will serve 1,050 Hobbits in Hobbiton and surrounding communities, with particular focus on the 189 displaced families, 650 traumatized individuals, and the broader community struggling with economic collapse and cultural disruption.

## THE SIX PROJECT COMPONENTS

### COMPONENT 1: Rebuild Homes and Communal Spaces

**Need Addressed:** 127 homes destroyed, 312 damaged, 189 families displaced

**Activities:**

**Activity 1.1: Bagshot Row Reconstruction (Months 1-12)**

Bagshot Row, the working-class neighborhood housing essential craftspeople, will be completely rebuilt using traditional Hobbit architectural methods enhanced with modern structural improvements:

- **Engineering Assessment (Month 1):** Dwarven engineers from Erebor will assess all 13 destroyed Bagshot Row hobbit-holes and provide structural plans ensuring stability and safety
- **Material Acquisition (Months 1-3):** Source local stone, timber from sustainable forestry (not Shire trees), and traditional building materials; Gimli's craftspeople will donate specialized stonework
- **Construction (Months 3-12):** Rebuild all 13 Bagshot Row homes using mixed crews of Dwarven master builders, Hobbit laborers learning traditional techniques, and volunteers
- **Priority Sequencing:** Homes housing displaced families with children or elderly members will be completed first

**Activity 1.2: Urgent Home Repairs (Months 1-9)**

For the 312 damaged homes, systematic repairs will restore safety and habitability:

- **Triage Assessment (Month 1):** Categorize all damaged homes by severity (critical/moderate/minor) and create repair schedules
- **Critical Repairs (Months 2-5):** Address 87 homes with structural instability, collapsed roofs, or flood damage requiring immediate attention
- **Moderate Repairs (Months 4-9):** Repair 225 homes with significant but non-emergency damage
- **Hobbit-Led Teams:** Train and employ 40 unemployed Hobbits in basic construction, creating local repair capacity that will outlast the grant period

**Activity 1.3: Community Gathering Spaces (Months 6-15)**

Restore the communal infrastructure essential to Hobbit culture:

- **Party Field Restoration (Months 6-12):** Clear and restore the field where the Party Tree stood, preparing for replanting (Component 3) and creating temporary community gathering space
- **Meeting Hall Repairs (Months 8-15):** Restore Hobbiton's town hall, currently unusable due to structural damage, to serve as venue for community gatherings, cultural events, and project meetings

**Outcomes:**
- 100% of destroyed Bagshot Row homes rebuilt (13 homes)
- 100% of critically damaged homes repaired and safe for habitation (87 homes)
- 75% of moderately damaged homes repaired (169 homes)
- 189 families moved from temporary housing into permanent homes
- 40 Hobbits trained in construction skills for ongoing maintenance
- Community gathering infrastructure restored

**Logic:** Stable housing → Reduced stress and health risks → Families can focus on economic recovery and healing rather than survival → Community cohesion strengthens through restored gathering spaces

## COMMUNITY-DRIVEN DESIGN PROCESS

This project emerged directly from community input, not external prescription:

**Phase 1: Liberation and Initial Recovery (Months 1-3 post-war)**
Mayor Samwise Gamgee organized community meetings in all Shire regions asking: "What do you need most?" The consistent priorities were: housing, farming restoration, healing, and cultural preservation.

**Phase 2: Formation of Shire Restoration Society (Month 4 post-war)**
Community leaders formally organized the Society with board representation from all affected populations: farmers, craftspeople, displaced families, veterans, and elders.

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Needs Assessment (Months 4-6 post-war)**
The Society conducted:
- Household surveys (847 families responded - 81% response rate)
- Focus groups with vulnerable populations
- Listening sessions in all Hobbiton neighborhoods
- Youth consultations

**Phase 4: Participatory Planning (Current)**
Draft project components were presented to community in open meetings. Residents provided feedback on priorities, sequencing, and implementation approaches. The current project design reflects that input:
- Bagshot Row prioritized because working-class families most affected
- Mental health included because residents identified it as critical unmet need
- Cultural preservation emphasized because elders expressed fear of knowledge loss
- Economic components reflect specific business needs identified by entrepreneurs

**Ongoing Community Governance:**
- Monthly open community meetings where residents review progress and provide feedback
- Project Advisory Committee with 12 community members representing diverse constituencies
- Mayor Gamgee serves as co-implementer, ensuring political support and community buy-in

**This is not a project done TO the Shire community. It is a project done BY and WITH the community, with external support providing resources and expertise to implement Hobbit-identified priorities.**
